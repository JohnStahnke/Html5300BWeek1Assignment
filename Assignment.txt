Create a Web page with an input field where the user enters numbers.

Each time the user enters a number, update the display to show how many numbers have been entered, the sum of the numbers, and the average of the numbers.

There should be a Reset button that allows the user to start over with a new sequence of numbers.

Your page should display an error message or otherwise prevent non-numeric input.

 Optional features: display the standard deviation and/or median of the numbers entered.
